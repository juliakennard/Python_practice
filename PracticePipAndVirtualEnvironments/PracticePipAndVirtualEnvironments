Practice Pip and Virtual Environments:

- The difference between pip list when the environment is active or inactive is that when I run pip list with the environment activated, I only had 3 items listed, whereas with the environment deactivated I had many more. 

- Because I had already installed Django in my environment, when I tried to reinstall Django, I got a message saying that the requirement has already been satisfied. 

- Freeze and list are different in that freeze does not list pip as one of the items in the environment.

- By running the command pip freeze > requirements.txt, the file was created on my desktop

- Inside the requirements.txt file, there is a long list of programs. 

- I installed Django and searched Flask.
